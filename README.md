WetterHH
========

Visualization of weather data in Hamburg, Germany. 

Done so far
-----------

Live weather data is grabbed from a near weather station and archived in a 
mongodb database. Graphs for airpressure and temperature are generated on the
fly when accessed via mobile optimized (jQuery mobile) web interface.

ToDo
----

* pretty scales on X-/Y-axis ✔
* more graphs (pimp the generic graph generator) ✔
* graph fine-tuning (smooth graphs on longer time intervals - MapReduce?) 
* caching strategy for already generated graphs
* cleanup/restructuring
* thinking about a deployment strategy ✔
* documentation
* mobile-optimized webinterface / mobile app(?) ✔
* ...
